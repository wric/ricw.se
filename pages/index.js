        My name is Richard this is my personal website. I am a 30-something guy
        living in Gothenburg, Sweden, with an interest in technology and design.
        This is where I plan to dump my creations and maybe write a few words
        about it.

        I am a MSc in Mechanical Engineering and I currectly work as a sofware
        engineer at an European CRM supplier. I mainly code my projects in
        Python and JS/Node but I do not hold strong opinions about languages â€” I
        use what is convenient and solves the problem.
