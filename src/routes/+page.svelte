<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>
	My name is Richard this is my personal website. I am a 30-something guy living in Gothenburg,
	Sweden, with an interest in technology and design. This is where I plan to dump my creations and
	maybe write a few words about it.
</p>

<p>
	I am a MSc in Mechanical Engineering and I currectly work as a sofware engineer at an European CRM
	supplier. I mainly code my projects in Python and JS/Node but I do not hold strong opinions about
	languages â€” I use what is convenient and solves the problem.
